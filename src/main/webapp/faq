        <br />  Here are the most common questions and misconceptions about BTGPA and GPA’s in general:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How does BTGPA calculate my GPA? </b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        The website parses PowerSchool using Jsoup and the user's login/password. Then it uses the GPA formula provided 
        <br />by guidance to calculate the GPA of the user by going through each row of the HTML table provided by Jsoup
        <br />and displays the calculated GPA.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Does BTGPA or Code Club record my password? Can the BTGPA creators see my grades and GPA?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        No. We do not record user information. That is against the law. BTGPA is simply a service made 
        <br />to help the students of BT and to solve a problem that many students face. BTGPA is not a scam 
        <br />for stealing user information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Why does my GPA on BTGPA look different than the one on powerschool?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        BTGPA displays your marking period GPA’s as well as your GPA for your current year while Powerschool 
        <br />displays your cumulative GPA (combination of all years). We are currently working on adding a feature 
        <br />to BTGPA to allow users to view cumulative GPA so stay tuned. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>The BTGPA results don’t seem right. I believe there is an error in the app. Where can I report it?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        If you believe there is an error within the app, feel free to email the Code Club founders 
        <br />at jennhe@bergen.org and/or rachle@bergen.org and describe your issue. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How can I view my cumulative GPA (average of all years)?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        Unfortunately, BTGPA does not display your cumulative GPA yet but we are working to add the feature. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Why should I use BTGPA instead of looking at Powerschool GPA?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        While Powerschool only updates your GPA after each marking period, BTGPA offers you real-time information 
        <br />based on your current grades.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Why is my year GPA not equal to the average of my marking period GPA’s?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        Your year GPA is not supposed to be an average of the four marking periods. 
        <br />Rather, it is calculated by taking the final grades of each class from the year column on 
        <br />Powerschool (the column all the way to the right) because this is what is going to appear 
        <br />on your college transcript. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>I am having trouble logging in. The site says my username or password is incorrect.</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        Make sure you are entering your Powerschool username and password, not your parent’s. 
        <br />The username should be the same as your Bergen webmail username (everything before the @bergen.org) 
        <br />and the password is same as your Bergen webmail password. If it still doesn’t work, contact us. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How accurate is this application?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        This app was created using the GPA formula provided by guidance. 
        <br />Electives, projects, and other special classes have been accounted for. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>I have a suggestion, where can I contact you? </b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        If you have a suggestion, feel free to e-mail jennhe@bergen.org and/or rachle@bergen.org. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Does anyone even use BTGPA?</b>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <br />
        So far, BTGPA has been used over 20,000 times with an average of about 100 logins each day.
